## Week 6 Reflection
This week we worked on figuring out the more specific needs for our project. We researched extensively the three parts (production, transportation, storage). After doing this we have made a few decisions. The first one is that instead of prioritizing efficient storage, we will prioritize actually making a functioning hydrogen generator. This is because chemical storage gets really complicated and expensive and we don't want to spend a large portion of our limited time on storage when it is not the most important part of our project. We also made the decision to use alkaline electrolysis because of its cost effectivity. To make sure our product is pure hydrogen we made the decisin to also be use a hydroxide transmitting membrane that will make sure the gasses stay separate. We found one potentially very valuable resource in the form of human knowledge. Jason Graetz is an employee of the Department of Energy, and works specifically on green hydrogen and its storage possibilities. To get in contact with him would mean a deeper understanding for all of us on how to approach this project and hydrogen production and storage in general. Other resources we found we well documented projects about compact hydrogen storage and fuel cells for the military conducted by the government. These have lots of great resources within them and are relatively simple to read. Some issues we discovered were difficulty with chemical storage of H2, as well as the membrane we will need for separating the hydrogen from the oxygen within the electrolysis chamber. Chemical storage ends up getting extremely complicated because of the wide variety of options. We currently have a lack of information about how it works, which has hindered us in creating a storage plan. As far as the membrane goes our problem is finding one that has been used before. We know the parameters for it, but there is little documentation out there about possible actual membrane examples. This week we found success in understanding the more complex parts of our project. We focused purely on research this week, and it paid off in the form of knowledge. We know now the exact materials we need to do this project, and we are almost ready to order them. We also have made good connections at American Elements who can sell us the products we need. It was difficult to go from understanding the broad concept of our project to the actual application, but through our thorough research we now have that knowledge. Our plan for next week is to create a plan for our hydrogen production system. This includes specifics such as the type of membrane we will use, vessels to transfer H2, etc.

## Week 7 Reflection
We worked on finding materials to buy for our project. We made decisions on what or what not to buy. For example zirfon - a OH transmitting membrane - we decided not to buy because we couldn't find anywhere to buy it. Instead we decided to buy Fumasep membrane. Another decision we made was whether or not we should buy carbon or graphite electrodes. We ended buying graphite rods because of their better conductivity. We found a resource in the form of a professor at UVA. Dr. Charles Machan helped us answer some questions about membranes and electrolyzers. One issue we discovered is that without a model, it is hard to know exactly what we will be missing when we move on to the next phase of our project. As far as what went well, we now have a nearly completed order list. Getting in contact with Dr. Machan was another success. We encontered many difficulties in many different forms. Some of these include questions about OH transmission, questions about electrolyzers, uncertainty about the vessel we will use for this, etc. Next week we hope to assemble a model for our project.

## Week 8 Reflection
This week we worked on designing a model housing system in onshape. We followed the idea from the pictures max had drew for it. We fully created the model in onshape with holders for the carbon rods and a divider to hold the membrane. A problem we ran into was keeping it from leaking water. There were many places water could leak out of it that would be frustrating to fix at a later date. A possible solution would be to 3D print the boxes then plastic dip them to keep them from leaking water. Another problem is the temperature from water electrolysis might melt the material from the 3D printer so we need to find a material that wont. The PSAT was this week and it was hard to get work done on that day. Next we we will focus on figuring out a model that wouldn't leak water and would fit our design idea.

## Week 9 Reflection
We worked on a housing for our electrolysis that wouldn't melt or leak. We decided that a premade glass container would be best, we decided on a glass beaker as a starting place, as it will not have leakage problems and it will not melt. We started trying to figure out how to add a divider into our container so we could add a membrane that is neccassary for our electrolosis. It became evident that tampering with the glass beaker would damage it, and we had to return it to the chem lab. This became a major challenge for us, as we needed to experinment with how to seal our divider, but we had no container to experiment on, we will figure this out next week. 

## Smart Goals for Q2
1. Create a prototype that includes our laser cut box, divider and a method to electrolyze the water (Everything except the membrane which will take a long time to ship) by winter break, so we are ready to start testing when the membrane arrive. We will mesure this by if we have it or not

2. Before thanksgiving break we will finish our onshape design and make sure we have a water tight box that can house electrolosis. 

## Week 10 Reflection
This week we figured out how to create a water tight box with acrylic 


## Week 11 Reflection


## Week 12 Reflection


## Week 13 Reflection
This week we worked on getting our box fully set up to be water tight. We ran into a problem with the divider walls not having holes in them for the membrane. That issue has been fixed and we are building the box to make everything water tight. Another problem we had the divider walls were too close together making it hard to caulk the walls inplace. These holes in in the walls should help with that too. Once we get the membrane and graphite rods we can fully set up our box and complete the prototype model. Next week we will keep working on making the box the best it can be for when we get those items.
